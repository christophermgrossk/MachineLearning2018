Interval Scheduling

	*Look at the first time* - only option is to choose bio & chem

		|-----Bio-----|          |----Chem----|
			    |-----Math----|
	
	*if optimization was to pick shortest time span first* -- only math

	*what would happen with a greedy algorithm?* -- the most classes possible would be picked

	# a greedy algorithm (unweighted) would try to accumulate the most classes, where as a weighted would depend on
	# something like credit hours

	*HOW DO WE SOLVE THIS?!*
		~Dynamic Programming~
